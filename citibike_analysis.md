# Module14_Bikesharing_Challenge
## Questions
1. Population of Des Moines vs New York City?
- Population density

2. Gender diversity?
- similar

## Execute Research
- Smaller scale based on density
Step 2: Execute Independent Research
The next critical step is conducting independent research. In this case, consult various resources to help you get a better picture of what a bike-sharing business would look like in Des Moines.

The goal is to find key pieces of information that are relevant to the question you selected and will help investors arrive a decision more easily. Here are a few resources you might look at:

Des Moines Census Data (Links to an external site.)
Des Moines Tourism Website (Links to an external site.)
New York and Des Moines McDonald's dataset.
## Step 3. Craft Your Tableau Story
Create a Tableau story answering the question you selected. Use story points and arrows to describe your findings.

Then publish your Tableau story and dashboards to Tableau Public. Tableau Public is a way to share dashboards or stories that you have created online.

Note

Note that Tableau Public should not be used for dashboards containing potentially private data; for this you should use Tableau Server. Private data is generally data that would have an impact to a business or person if it were released into the public.

Since the data you're using is not considered private data, you can use Tableau Public.
 

You can publish your analysis to Tableau Public through the Tableau app. Follow these steps.

Go to the Server dropdown menu and select Tableau Public.
Click "Save to Tableau Public."
To publish your analysis, log in to your Tableau account.
For more information, see Tableau's documentation on saving workbooks to Tableau Public (Links to an external site.).

Next, copy the link to use in your written analysis.

## Step 4: Create a Written Analysis
The goal of your written analysis is to share additional thoughts with your audience, expanding on details and clarifying points that they may not understand. Stories in Tableau can be fairly open-ended, so a written analysis allows you to further share your insights and interpretation of the data in order to help your case.

Length
There is no official guideline for how long a written analysis should be, but you should write enough to convey your points.

Content
Your written analysis can include all or some of the following:

A summary of your analysis
A summary of each page in the Tableau story
Clarifying any data that is unclear or complex
Format
Write your analysis in a markdown file named citibike_analysis.md, using VS Code. Your document should include a title. There are different sizes, or levels, of headings that correspond to the number of "#" signs preceding the title. For example:

# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
##  Smaller Title
### Even Smaller Title
