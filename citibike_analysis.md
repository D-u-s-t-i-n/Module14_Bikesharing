# Module14_Bikesharing_Challenge
[Tableau Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dustin2495#!/vizhome/Challenge_15865917101600/Module14_Challenge?publish=yes)
For the investor pitch, let's look at the Module14_Challenge story tab within the Challenge.twb Tableau workbook. 
The story is compromised of 6 sections: 
 - The first page displays the New York City city bike data.
 -- New York City has a successful bicycle-sharing system, and will use this as a reference model. 
 - The 2nd pages will start off with the difference between NYC and Des Moines city data to address potential concerns with this investment.
 - The remaining pages show some encouraging differences and similarities of NYC and Des Moines data to demonstrate why Des Moines bicycle-sharing program would be a worthwhile investment. 
After everyone has looked at the first page, let's move onto discussing the NYC & Des Moines comparison pages.
## Questions
The following questions were explored in this exercise.
1. Population of Des Moines vs New York City (2018)?
- 216,853 vs 8,398,748

2. Gender diversity?
- NYC data showed that males were majority of the customers.
- We see the gender breakdown is similar between the two cities (50% vs 52%)

## Research Sources
The following sources were used for comparison between NYC and Des Moines:
- Citi Bike (citibikenyc.com)
- US Census (census.gov)
- Best Places (bestplaces.net)

## Observations
Des Moines population smaller, so the business scale will definitely be smaller than that of NYC Citi Bike's. But the following points make it a safe investment for a successful business:
 - Its population is growing at a higher % rate. Although there is a large disparity of population, we see that Des Moines population increase from the last decade is > 60% compared to NYC's < 30%. 
 - Although the population ratio is discouragingly 40 times different between the cities, the population density for Des Moines is 2,516 per square mile vs NYC's 27,013 - that is only a little over 10x difference. The area between the two cities is 4x different (21.4	vs 88.2 squared miles). By strategically placing bike stations in populated areas, we can minimize costs.
 - The average commute distance is shorter for Des Moines (19 miles) than NYC (41.2 miles). This shorter commute can lead to a larger % of the population to turn to bike services if it becomes available.
